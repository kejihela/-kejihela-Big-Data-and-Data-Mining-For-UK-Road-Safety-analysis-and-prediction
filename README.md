# Big-Data-and-Data-Mining-For-UK-Road-Safety-analysis-and-prediction 🚙 🏍️ 🧑‍🦲
Here Our mission is to analyze road safety data that would aid the government authorities on how to improve road safety and to develop a model that can forecast accidents and injuries.

Every year, the government makes available a vast amount of data related to these reports. We used the data from 2019 for this study because it is a fairly full sample with a lot of supplementary data.The data which includes the following files:

(1)	variable lookup. This sheet give a full details of the large amount of variables present in each of our datasets. 
(2)	Road Safety Data - Casualties 2019. This excel file details the casualties contained in the logged accidents.
(3)	Road Safety Data- Vehicles 2019. This  excel file details  the vehicles involved in the accidents. 
(4)	Road Safety Data - Accidents 2019. This excel file details the accidents logged in 2019.
(6)	Adjustment Files. For each accident, these files contain government modeling for the odds of particular injuries occuring.
    (i)	adjustment figure guidance. This provides a short amount of government guidance on the figures included. 
    (ii)	cas_adjustment_lookup_2019. This spreadsheet contains the tabulated adjusted probabilities of injuries
    
  **Attempted Question**
  
(a)	Are there certain times of the day and days of the week when pedestrians are more likely to be involved in accidents?
(b)	Are there specific hours of the day and days of the week when motorcycle accidents occur?
(c) Are there certain times of the day and days of the week when accidents are more likely to occur?
(d)	What effect, if any, does the timing of dawn and sunset have on traffic accidents?
(e)	What effect, if any, does daylight savings time have on traffic accidents the week before and after it begins and ends?
(f)	Are there any vehicle kinds that are more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents?
(g)	Are there any specific circumstances (weather, geographic location, or scenarios) that lead to an increase in road traffic accidents?
(h) What effect do driver-related characteristics (such as the driver's age and the purpose of the voyage) have on the outcome?
(i)	used provided data to improve road safety to forecast when and where accidents will occur, as well as the severity of the injuries sustained? How do our models stack up against those of the government?
